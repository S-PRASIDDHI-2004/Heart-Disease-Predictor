# Heart-Disease-Predictor

The Heart Disease Predictor is a tool designed to assist in predicting the likelihood of a patient having heart disease. Utilizing a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the predictor leverages various health-related parameters to make its predictions. These parameters include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, rest ECG results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and a thalassemia condition.

The model employs logistic regression, a robust algorithm for binary classification tasks, to analyze these parameters and predict whether a patient has heart disease. The tool aims to provide healthcare professionals with a reliable, data-driven method to identify patients at risk, facilitating early intervention and potentially improving patient outcomes. The Heart Disease Predictor emphasizes accuracy and interpretability, ensuring that the predictions can be trusted and easily understood by medical practitioners.
