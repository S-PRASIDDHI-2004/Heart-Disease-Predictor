# Heart Disease Prediction

Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various health parameters. This model aims to assist healthcare professionals in identifying patients at risk of heart disease, facilitating early diagnosis and intervention.

Data Source
The dataset used for this project is the Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset includes multiple health-related metrics such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar, rest ECG results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia.

Import Libraries
To start the project, the necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning were imported. These libraries include pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.linear_model, and sklearn.metrics.

Import Data
The dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame for analysis and preprocessing.

Describe Data
The structure of the dataset was examined through various methods, including checking for information about the dataset, summary statistics, and viewing the first few rows. This helped in understanding the dataset's features, their types, and basic statistics.

Data Visualization
Data visualization techniques were used to understand relationships and correlations between different features. This included generating a correlation heatmap to visualize the correlation between features and creating a pairplot to visualize pairwise relationships between features and the target variable.

Data Preprocessing
The data was preprocessed to prepare it for modeling. This involved checking for missing values and standardizing the feature variables to ensure they have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. This standardization is crucial for the performance of many machine learning algorithms.

Define Target Variable (y) and Feature Variables (X)
The target variable (y) was defined as the presence of heart disease, and the feature variables (X) were defined as the various health metrics provided in the dataset.

Train Test Split
The dataset was split into training and testing sets. This split is essential to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data, ensuring that the model generalizes well to new data.

Modeling
A logistic regression model was created and trained on the training data. Logistic regression is a suitable choice for binary classification tasks like predicting the presence or absence of heart disease.

Model Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated on the test set using several metrics, including the confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score. These metrics provide insights into the model's precision, recall, F1-score, and overall accuracy, which are crucial for understanding the model's effectiveness.

Prediction
The trained model was demonstrated to make predictions on new data. This step illustrates the model's practical application in predicting the presence of heart disease based on new patient data.

Explanation
The logistic regression model was used to predict the presence of heart disease. The model was trained on a standardized dataset, which was split into training and testing sets. After training, the model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as the confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score. The model's predictions were also demonstrated on new data points, showcasing its practical application in predicting heart disease based on patient health metrics. This comprehensive approach ensures that the model is robust and reliable for assisting healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and intervention of heart disease.
